As a way to refresh my memory of Java, which I have not used in a year, I want to make my first programming project of the year a program that is a calendar of sorts, using Java. But, I want to encorporate in this program some form of creating users and playing around with how that works. I also want to work more on using graphics withing Java and try to as I said get the more basic things down again in order to allow me to work on larger and more challenging projects later in the year. I also want to find out how to get a program collecting teh date and time from the computer it is on, and maybe even making some basic form of notifications.
